## Welcome to perm.link

Link rot is a pervasive issue affecting websites, organizations, and users alike. Valuable content and resources get lost over time as links break or become obsolete. perm.link is here to ensure your links remain active, accurate, and reliable.

## What is Link Rot?

Link rot occurs when hyperlinks no longer point to their original destinations due to changes in the URL structure, website updates, or domain changes. This results in:

- **Lost Content**: Users can't access the information they need.
- **Damaged Credibility**: Broken links reduce the trustworthiness of websites.
- **Reduced SEO Performance**: Search engines penalize sites with numerous broken links.
- **Frustrated Users**: Visitors encounter dead ends and errors.

The phenomenon of link rot is more widespread than many realize. According to a study by the Harvard Law School, approximately 50% of the links in Supreme Court opinions are broken. Another study revealed that around 25% of links in scientific papers become inactive after just three years. A comprehensive analysis of URLs in medical and scientific journals found that nearly 50% of links were inactive after seven years. Additionally, research by the Internet Archive indicated that 49% of links cited in New York Times articles were dead within a decade.

The impact of link rot extends beyond academia and journalism. A study by the HathiTrust Digital Library found that over 20% of links in digital collections had decayed. Moreover, a report from the Pew Research Center highlighted that government websites are also susceptible, with many federal, state, and local sites containing numerous broken links, leading to a loss of valuable public information.

The economic cost of link rot is significant as well. Businesses can lose customers and revenue due to broken links, as users are less likely to trust and return to websites with poor maintenance. In e-commerce, broken product links can directly translate to lost sales and damaged brand reputation.

Addressing link rot is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the web as a reliable source of information. As more content is created and shared online, the challenge of keeping links functional and up-to-date grows. This is where perm.link comes in, offering a robust solution to ensure the longevity and reliability of hyperlinks.
